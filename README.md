# article-classification
Using various supervised learning models for classification of BBC news articles by topic.

The main purpose of this group project is to investigate supervised learning algorithms for article classification on BBC news datasets using LR, NB, SVM, NNs.

Dataset: BBC news articles.

Each news article is a comma-separated line with three columns: news ID, processed news body, news class. The news bodies have preprocessed by tokenization and lower-cased with removal of stop words and special characters. Two data files are uploaded, train.csv and test.csv.

The provided notebook outlines our group's project including some data preprocessing, EDA, model learning, hyperparamter tuning and evaluation.
